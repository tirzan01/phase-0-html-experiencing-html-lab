On our `li`
tags we've added the attribute called `class`. 

The thing on the right side of
the `=` sign is what the tag's "class name" is. 

While we might have multiple instances of a class member (many `songs`) there's
only one `description` paragraph. HTML with an `id` attributes have to be
unique. Because we used the name `description` here we can't use it anywhere
else in the document.

#### Talking Like an HTML Author

Now that you **are** an HTML author, we're going to show some some sentences
that will help you gain comfort with the vocab that HTML authors say to one
another.

The goal is to help you gain an intuition about talking about writing HTML.
You're not expected to memorize these phrases. Each phrase is a statement which
HTML authors might use to express what's going on in this experience we just
created.

* The HTML file `my_list.html` is called the "HTML file" or the _source text_
* Inthe _HTML file_, _content_ and _markup_ exist together and are visible in
  our _text editor_
* When HTML _source text_ (or, _HTML source_) is viewed by a browser, it
  becomes _rendered text_
* The **viewing tab** is now showing a _rendered view_ of our HTML _source
  text_
* The HTML elements ("the angle brackets") that define the _markup_ are used to
  lay out the page while our _content_ is displayed or "rendered"
* The HTML elements ("the angle brackets") are removed because their function
  is to _format_ the content, _not_ be the content itself
* Our **viewing tab** shows the _rendered text_ (or, _render_) of our HTML
  _source text_
* In the **viewing tab** we can view the _source text_ that it _rendered_
At this point we've worked with HTML some and have learned four very important
terms used by HTML authors.
